## 🤔 To do
- Add API endpoint for it? (e.g. FastAPI)
    - ✅ Done, FastAPI branch is merged into main branch
- What if someone transfer and deposit at the sametime?
    - Add lock
- Should I handle concurrency?
    - I don’t need to handle concurrency if I am only calling methods in sequence (e.g., CLI scripts, single-threaded simulation).
    - But if we're planning to:
        - Expose it as a web service,
        - Load test it,
        - Or run it in production or multi-user simulation,
    - Then we should start thinking about thread-safety.
- What if someone is making a lot of transactions and blocking others?
    - Add per-account locks, retry logic, and rate limiting together to ensure safety and fairness.
